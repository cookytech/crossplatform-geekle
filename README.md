## Disclaimers

### We are delivering this topic as enthusiasts, not experts.
This is a nascent technology and we are a small company of relatively young programmers, who have a knack for delivering solidly.
We do not to claim to be experts, We do not claim 10x years of experience, We do not claim marketing words like "Battle Hardened"

### Thoughts are our own
We have our own questions and motivations, our own ways of finding those answers and our own answers that we found through those methods. Our claims here do not represent 
the claims of the official maintainers of these technology and other than us being really thankful for these technolgies we do not have any working relationships with these teams.

### We are always open to more experienced opinion
As beginners we found it hard to get to the nectar of things. We are trying to build a bridge while trying to cross the gaps. We always 
welcome more experienced opinions and guidance.
